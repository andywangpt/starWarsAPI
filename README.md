<b>Summary</b>

The user can input the name of the expense, date, place of purchase, and amount.  The app will output the expense in a table below.

This expense tracking application is my first foray into React and into frameworks in general.  This is my first taste of using state and props within React and I've learned about about components and how they contribute to the power and scability of using React.
